# Kine Wheel Arena – DLC

*Kine Wheel Arena – DLC* is an open-source experimental setup for markerless paw tracking of head-fixed mice running on a wheel.
The apparatus is based on the open-source motion tracking system [(KineMouse Wheel)](https://hackaday.io/project/160744-kinemouse-wheel) designed by [Richard Warren](https://richard-warren.github.io/). It has been extended with a camera, lighting, and a controller to run both in synchronization.
Tracking is done using a Deep Neural Network trained with [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) (DLC). The system is available for purchase at [LABmaker](https://www.labmaker.org/).
